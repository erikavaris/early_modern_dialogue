# Dialogue bot for Early Modern English

Playing with a seq2seq style chatbot trained on Early Modern English (ie., a Shakespeare chatbot)

## System Notes

Python 3.5

## About the project

I put this project together mostly as a training exercise for myself, to go through the procedure of creating a simple chatbot, and also to test out the simple hypothesis that if you train a system with stylized language, the results will be in that style as well. Sounds obvious, but stylized language generation has other applications, so it's nice to confirm that it works.
